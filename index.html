      <h2>About</h2>
      <p></p><span class='italicized'>Angus </span> was released in 1995 and tells the story of an awkward, overweight, and self-concious teenager as he goes through a rough year in high school. </p>
      <h2>Importance</h2>
      <p>Although I did not know it at the time, <span class='italicized'>Angus </span>did not have a great reception on release. I am also sure that many people who view it today would also not give it much praise. But at the time I first saw <span class='italicized'>Angus </span>I was 8 years old and held many of the same "abnormal" traits that Angus, the character, had. I also saw these same traits in other people in my life.</p>
